Development environment:

	Windows:
		WQIS is compatible with either XAMPP or WAMP.

		1. Install XAMPP or WAMP as prefered.

		2. Create a new folder for WQIS. If using XAMPP, this should be at C:\xampp\htdocs\WQIS. If using WAMP, this should be at [TBD]. Capitalization does matter.

		3. Download CakePHP. We are currently using CakePHP 3.8.3, this can be downloaded from https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/3.8.3 . Copy the bin and vendor folders to the WQIS folder, and create a new "logs" folder. Don't touch anything else

		4. The default settings for phpmyadmin don't allow you to import a file as large as our sql dump. We need to reconfigure that. Go to C:\xampp\php\php.ini, and make these changes: [WAMP instructions coming soon]

		post_max_size = 128M
		upload_max_filesize = 128M
		max_execution_time = 300
		max_input_time = 300

		5. Start xampp-control (C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe). Enable Apache and MySQL. Go to localhost, you should see the WQIS homepage but you won't be able to login.

		6. From xampp-control, click the admin button next to MySql (or just go to localhost/phpmyadmin). Click "Databases" in the top row, and create a new database called wqis_db.

		7. Now click "Import" in the top row, then "browse", then select the sql file at C:\xampp\htdocs\wqis\MariaDB Sql File\wqis_db.sql. Then click "Go". It may take a few seconds

		8. On the left panel you should now see the wqis_db database, and should be able to view its entries.

		9. We need to create a new user that the system itself will use to access the database. Go to "Home", then "user accounts", then "add user". Create a new user with username "programUser" and password "waterquality". Grant this user all "Data" privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FILE)

		10. You should now be able to log in to WQIS. Use the root account, password is waterquality

	Linux:
		[TBD]

	MacOS:
		MAMP is recommended for WQIS setup on MacOS. It is possible to use XAMPP if necessary, but MAMP is much easier to setup for WQIS and seems to run more reliably on MacOS.

		1. Install and open MAMP.

		2. In Finder, create a new folder called "WQIS" in the htdocs folder (Path: Applications/MAMP/htdocs/WQIS). Copy all of the contents from the GitHub repo into this folder.

		3. Download CakePHP. We are currently using CakePHP 3.8.3, this can be downloaded from https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/3.8.3. Copy the bin and vendor folders from cakephp-3-8-3 to the WQIS folder (replace the existing bin and vendor folders), and create a new "logs" folder.

		4. The default settings for phpmyadmin don't allow you to import a file as large as our SQL dump, so we need to reconfigure that. Go to MAMP/conf/php7.3.8/php.ini, and make these changes:

			post_max_size = 128M
			upload_max_filesize = 128M
			max_execution_time = 300
			max_input_time = 300

		5. Go to localhost:8888/phpmyadmin. Click "Databases" in the top row, and create a new database called wqis_db.

		6. Now click "Import" in the top row, then "browse", then select the sql file at MAMP/htdocs/WQIS/MariaDB Sql File/wqis_db.sql. Then click "Go". It may take a few seconds. 
		
		7. On the left panel you should now see the wqis_db database, and should be able to view its entries.

		8. We need to create a new user that the system itself will use to access the database. Go to "Home", then "user accounts", then "add user". Create a new user with username "programUser" and password "waterquality". Grant this user all "Data" privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FILE).

		9. Go to MAMP/htdocs/WQIS/config/app.php. Make sure 'host' => 'localhost' (~line 225), and 'port' => '8889' (~line 231).

		10. You should now be able to log in to wqis. Use the root account, password is waterquality.

Live server:
	1. Follow the instructions for the development environment first

	2. The app configuration file included is intended for use in a development environment, because that is where it will most commonly be deployed. At WQIS/config/app.php, line 225, you should see "'host' => 'localhost'". We need to specify the port number for MariaDB, by default this is 3307 (consult the server administrator if needed). Change "localhost" to "localhost:3307".
